* RbToolbox [[https://secure.travis-ci.org/eifion/url_formatter.png]]


This gem contains some features I use all the time and aren't part of the standard library.

** Usage

*** Structs
I like my structs to be initialized using named instead of positional arguments.

=RbToolbox::Struct= uses named arguments.

It has all the features you may expect from a =::Struct=

To create a Struct:
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
require "rb_toolbox/struct"
Point = RbToolbox::Struct.new(:x, :y)

p = Point.new(y: 5, x: 4)

p.x # => 4
p.y # => 5
#+END_SRC

#+results:

*** TODO String helpers (TODO)

** Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rb-toolbox'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rb-toolbox
